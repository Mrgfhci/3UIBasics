scraped the idea of using a gif.

made an array that loops through the frames instead.

the gifs where moving to fast and the only way to slow them down is to slow down the fps of the entire

game which made everything jumpy.

i read over this article which gave me a better idea of how to time my game and the structure of the game overall
